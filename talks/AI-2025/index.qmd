::: {.column width="60%" .fragment style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
Write a full JavaScript webpage to play tic-tac-toe against the computer; it needs to be completely working code. Here are the rules:

* The computer goes first.
* The person clicks on squares to make their move.
* The computer should play perfectly and so never lose.
* If someone wins, then say who won.

## always invite AI to the table

<br>

Identify the **Jagged Frontier of AI**. 

<br>
Learn the AI's strengths and weaknesses through continuous experimentation.

## be the human in the loop

You need to provide 

:::{.r-stack}
* crucial oversight
* your unique perspective
* critical thinking skills
* ethical considerations
:::



Beware of hallucinations or of the AI wanting to give you BS answers just to keep you happy.

## 3 kinds of tasks

Just Me Tasks

* tasks in which the AI is not useful and only gets in the way, at least for now
* tasks that you strongly believe should remain human, with no AI help

---

## 3 kinds of tasks

Delegated Tasks

* tasks that you assign the AI and may carefully check (the AI makes stuff up all the time), but ultimately do not want to spend a lot of time on. 
* usually stuff you really don’t want to do and is of low importance, or time-consuming
* the perfect Delegated Task is tedious, repetitive, or boring for humans but easy and efficient for AI.

---

## 3 kinds of tasks

Automated Tasks

* tasks you leave completely to the AI and don’t even check on
* usually we stop calling the algorithm "AI" at this point

## {{< iconify tabler microphone-filled >}}  Voice mode

live chat:

voice input instead of text input:

* When you're not sure how to explain something, just talk to it. Give it your random thoughts and the AI will return a sensible paragraph to you

## {{< iconify mingcute code-line >}} It's better to use code

Right now, there is no good way of exporting to proprietary formats, e.g. Word, Excel, etc.

You can use instead

* LaTeX
* other **Open Source** formats
